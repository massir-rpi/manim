# Manim Test Project

This repository contains example scenes and configuration for using [Manim](https://www.manim.community/), a mathematical animation engine written in Python.

## Structure

- `main.py`: Example Manim scenes, including algebraic transformations and geometric animations.
- `manim.cfg`: Manim configuration file.
- `media/`: Output directory for images, videos, and LaTeX files generated by Manim.
- `.gitignore`: Specifies files and folders to exclude from version control.

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- Manim (install via `pip install manim`)
- LaTeX (for rendering mathematical formulas, e.g., `sudo apt install texlive-full`)

## Usage

To render a scene, run:

```bash
manim main.py SceneName
```
Replace `SceneName` with the name of the scene class you want to render (e.g., `QuadraticFormula`).

Output videos and images will be saved in the `media/` directory.

## Example Scenes

- `DefaultTemplate`: Demonstrates basic shape creation and transformation.
- `QuadraticFormula`: Shows algebraic manipulation of the quadratic formula with animated transformations.
